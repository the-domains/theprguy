## [Communication Planning][0]

# Planning a communication program or campaign is an art and a science.

Through a straightforward, rigorous, facilitated structure, the workshop drives the communication team through a step-by-step process that starts with defining the problem or opportunity the plan is supposed to address. Depending on the core competencies of the participants, the extent to which the actual communication plan is developed during the workshop itself will vary.  In every case, the participants leave the program with a "ready to go" framework to complete a specific communication plan with the appropriate communication professionals in the organization.

There's no shortage of communication planning models in the public relations literature.  Yet for many reasons (that could be the subject of another workshop) many organizations seem unaware that they exist.  So I've developed [a structured workshop][1] that provides a communication planning team with the science they need to discover the art.

As a public relations educator and judge of countless regional and national public relations programs, I've evaluated far too many communication "plans" that set-out to "educate the public," "generate excitement," and "position the client as a leading provider of solutions in the insert-your-product-here space."

The science is in [the planning process][2], the art is in the content.  It's impossible to find the art without the science.  Yet so many communication "planning" processes start with a clever tactical idea and some vague goals or, worse, they're cobbled together in response to a management directive such as "get our name out there to the public."
